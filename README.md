# VBA Homework - The VBA of Wall Street

## Background

In this homework assignment, I used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 

### Files

* [Test Data](Resources/alphabetical_testing.xlsx) - Use this while developing your scripts.

* [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - Run your scripts on this data to generate the final homework report.


## Assignment Instructions

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

## RESULTS

* My solution returned the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
